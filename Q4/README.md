## Workflow Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of a single job:

1. **Build and Test**: Builds the project, runs tests, creates and pushes a Docker image, deploys the service, and runs integration tests.

## Prerequisites

To use this workflow, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

## Workflow Trigger

The workflow is triggered on push to the `main` branch and on pull requests to the `main` branch.

## Jobs Description

### Build and Test

- Sets up Node.js
- Installs dependencies
- Runs unit tests
- Logs in to Docker Hub
- Builds and pushes a Docker image
- Deploys the service using Docker Compose
- Runs integration tests
- Cleans up the deployment

## Integrating Fuzz Testing

To integrate fuzz testing into this CI/CD pipeline:

1. Set up a separate cron job to execute fuzz tests periodically, rather than including them in the main CI/CD pipeline.
2. Use tools like go-fuzz, AFL++, libFuzzer, or Jazzer depending on your smart contract implementation.
3. For smart contract fuzzing, incorporate tools like Echidna, Foundry/Forge, Mythril, or Manticore.
4. Store and reuse corpus data to improve fuzzing efficiency over time.
5. Track code coverage during fuzzing to identify areas needing more attention.
6. Configure the cron job to run extensive fuzzing at regular intervals, such as daily or weekly.
