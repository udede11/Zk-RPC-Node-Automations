# Performance Issue Investigation Tools

This repository contains tools and scripts for investigating performance issues in blockchain operations, specifically for the CDK-Erigon client.

## Contents

1. `report.md`: A template for reporting performance issues to the development team.
2. `run-and-trace.sh`: A shell script containing commands for tracing and measuring performance of the node or Docker container.

## Usage

### Performance Issue Report

The `report.md` file provides a structured template for documenting performance issues. It includes sections for:

- Issue Summary
- Reproduction Steps
- Trace Analysis

Use this template when reporting issues to the development team.

### Tracing and Performance Measurement

The `run-and-trace.sh` script contains various commands for tracing and measuring performance:

1. Get execution trace with timing:
   ```
   cast rpc debug_traceTransaction <tx-hash> --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
   ```

2. System metrics during execution:
   - Disk I/O: `iostat -x 1`
   - Virtual memory stats: `vmstat 1`
   - CPU usage per thread: `top -H -p <pid>`

3. CPU profiling:
   ```
   perf record -g -p <pid>
   perf report
   ```

4. Memory profiling:
   ```
   heaptrack <process>
   ```

## Optimization Steps

After identifying the bottleneck, consider the following optimization steps:

1. Node Configuration Issues:
   - Adjust cache sizes
   - Modify garbage collection settings
   - Update sync modes
   - Tune transaction pool settings

2. Network Issues:
   - Adjust peer limits
   - Modify network timeouts
   - Update discovery settings

3. Container Issues:
   - Adjust resource limits
   - Modify container networking
   - Update volume mounts

4. Client Software Issues:
   - Report to development team
   - Try different client versions
   - Consider alternative clients
